Hi, my name is Vincent, and I'm 27 years old living in Taoyuan, Taiwan. I started studying machine learning four years ago, and I've been hooked ever since. I've explored a range of areas within the field, including natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning, and audio-related machine learning problems.

I'm currently working as a machine learning engineer at a startup, where I use my expertise to solve text and audio-related problems. One of my key areas of focus is leveraging transformer models to build efficient and effective solutions. I've developed models that can perform tasks such as text classification, audio classification/regression, dereverberation, multimodal classification, and more.

Once we've developed our models and served them using Flask or Django frameworks, We containerize and deploy them to Kubernetes or AWS EC2 using CircleCI.

I've created this blog to share my ML experience with others and to learn from others in the field. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me via email or Twitter. I look forward to hearing from you!
